Key visualized metrics include:

Subscription Plan Insights: A breakdown of users by subscription type (Premium, Standard, Basic) to identify customer segments and optimize ad placements accordingly.

Geographic Distribution: A map highlights user locations across the U.S., facilitating location-based ad targeting to improve relevance and ad campaign effectiveness.

Payment Method Analysis: Insights into total payments by method (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa), offering valuable data for aligning payment preferences with targeted promotions and partnerships.

Genre-based User Engagement: Analysis of preferred genres (e.g., Documentary, Drama, Comedy) to tailor ads based on content consumption patterns, increasing the likelihood of ad engagement.

This data-driven approach allows for an optimized ad recommendation strategy, ensuring Netflix delivers high-impact, relevant advertisements that align with both user preferences and advertiser goals.
