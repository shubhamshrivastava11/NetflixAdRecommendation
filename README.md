## Key Visualized Metrics Include: 

**Subscription Plan Insights:** A breakdown of users by subscription type (Premium, Standard, Basic) to identify customer segments and optimize ad placements accordingly.

**Geographic Distribution:** A map highlights user locations across the U.S., facilitating location-based ad targeting to improve relevance and ad campaign effectiveness.

**Payment Method Analysis:** Insights into total payments by method (American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa), offering valuable data for aligning payment preferences with targeted promotions and partnerships.

**Genre-based User Engagement:** Analysis of preferred genres (e.g., Documentary, Drama, Comedy) to tailor ads based on content consumption patterns, increasing the likelihood of ad engagement.

## Analysis 
This data-driven approach allows for an optimized ad recommendation strategy, ensuring Netflix delivers high-impact, relevant advertisements that align with both user preferences and advertiser goals.
